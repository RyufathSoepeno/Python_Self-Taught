🧠 Simple Rule to Remember
If you want to...

Execute something
Use ()

Store multiple values
Use[]

Accessing Object / Dictionary Keys
Use[]

Get something from a container
Use []

Change math priority
Use ()

Define function parameters
Use()

🔥 Quick Mental Trick
() → Action
[] → Container

# Colons

Strict Equality (===)
This is like == only difference is it make sure the data type is similar, not just the result (2.5 can be float and double)

Tip: (:) is for inside the bracket, (=) is for assign/store

🧠 (=) vs (:) 

(:) can be used for

Range-based for loops: In a range-based for loop (C++11 and later), the colon separates the iteration variable from the range to be iterated over.
Example: for (auto x : range) {}.

Conditional (Ternary) Operator: As part of the ? : operator.
Example: auto r = b ? "yes" : "no";.

Member Initializer Lists: In a constructor definition, a colon introduces a member initializer list to initialize member variables and call base class constructors before the constructor's body executes. This is more efficient than assignment within the body and necessary for const members and references.
Example: MyClass() : member(value) {}.

Inheritance: In a class or struct declaration, the colon specifies the base class(es) from which the class inherits.
Example: struct Derived : Base {}.

Access Specifiers: Used after access specifiers (public:, private:, protected:) within a class declaration.

Bit Fields: In a struct or class, a colon can define the number of bits a data member should occupy, allowing memory packing.
Example: struct S { bool x : 1; };.



Symbol
Meaning
= --> assign value

: (Python) --> start block

: (dict/JSON) --> key → value

: (TypeScript) --> type

: (C++ class) --> inheritance

: (PHP) --> $status = ($user_logged_in) ? 'logged in' : 'logged out'; (Ternary Operator)


# Declaring List and Array

Python:
List and Array declared with []
You can also import array for better documentation

Only difference is Array must be same data type

	Python has a tuple that can be declared instantly
	Tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4); list = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Java:
Array uses String[]
List uses ArrayList<data_type> or LinkedList<data_type> package

	Tuples either made manually or use JavaTuple

JavaScript:
List and Array declared with []
Array already dynamic like lists by default

	No Tuples; made manually

PHP:
List and Array declared with []
Array already dynamic like lists by default

	No Tuples; made manually

C++:
Array (fixed size)


int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
Dynamic Array (Vector – most common list)


#include <vector>
std::vector<int> list = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
Linked List


#include <list>
std::list<int> list = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

  std::tuple

# Pointers

-> in PHP is pointer
Means giving access to an object or method (its properties)

Ex:
$user->name;
$user->getEmail();


. in Java is pointer

Ex:
user.name
user.getEmail()

🐘 PHP
Object access operator
Used to access properties or methods of an object.
$user->name;
$user->getEmail();
👉 Means: “Access member of this object”

☕ Java
Lambda expression
Introduced in Java 8.
(x) -> x * 2
👉 Means: “Maps parameters to expression/body”

🟨 JavaScript
Arrow function
(x) => x * 2
👉 JavaScript uses =>, not ->.

🐍 Python
Function return type annotation
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
   return a + b
👉 Means: “This function returns this type”
Also used in match cases (3.10+) internally but mainly type hints.

🦀 Rust
Return type separator
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
   a + b
}
👉 Means: “Function returns this type”
🐘 C
Pointer-to-struct member access
ptr->value;
Equivalent to:
(*ptr).value;
👉 Means: “Access struct member via pointer”

➕ C++
Same as C for pointers:
objPtr->method();
Also used in lambda trailing return types:
auto f() -> int;
